# Airports-Management
Spring boot back-end application for management Airports and Flights

My steps of opening and runnign the application.

1. After succesfully connecting to the database I created in postgress and transfered the data from the 2 csv files as 2 tables i double-checked using pgAdmin. (csv has same data but different column names from the ones i got..) *TIP- after making sure pgAdmins data match use Intelij right-sided database menu to connect and check it from there!

2. Select the PlanesApplication.java file and run it ! It should work right away without any issue. 


You should get something like this :
